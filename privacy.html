    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong><p>This privacy policy applies to the ContactZen app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by ContactZen (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p><br><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong><p>The Application accesses your device's Contacts with your permission in order to provide its core functionality: helping you review, organize, and manage your contacts. Contact data is stored and processed entirely on your device and is never transmitted to any external server or third party.</p><p>The Application also stores usage statistics (such as the number of contacts reviewed and your current streak) locally on your device to track your progress. This data never leaves your device.</p><p>The Application does not collect:</p><ul><li>Your IP address</li><li>Device identifiers or operating system information</li><li>Usage analytics or behavioral tracking data</li><li>Location data</li></ul><p>The Application makes no network calls and contains no analytics or tracking SDKs.</p><br><strong>Contacts Access</strong><p>The Application requires access to your device's Contacts in order to function. When you grant permission, the Application reads your contact list so you can review, tag, archive, and manage your contacts. All contact data remains on your device. The Application does not copy, upload, or share your contact data with anyone.</p><br><strong>Third Party Access</strong><p>The Application does not transmit any user data to third parties. No aggregated, anonymized, or personally identifiable data is shared with external services.</p><p>The only external service interaction is with Apple's StoreKit framework for processing in-app subscription purchases. These transactions are handled entirely by Apple in accordance with <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p>The Service Provider may disclose information:</p><ul><li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</li><li>when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li></ul><br><strong>Opt-Out Rights</strong><p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. You can also revoke the Application's access to your Contacts at any time through your device's Settings.</p><br><strong>Data Retention Policy</strong><p>All data used by the Application is stored locally on your device. No user data is stored on external servers. If you uninstall the Application, all locally stored data is removed. If you have questions about your data, please contact us at contactzen@protonmail.com.</p><br><strong>Children</strong><p>The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p><div><br><p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (contactzen@protonmail.com) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p></div><br><strong>Security</strong><p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. Because all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on the security of your device. The Service Provider recommends using a passcode or biometric lock on your device.</p><br><strong>Changes</strong><p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p><br><p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2026-01-03</p><br><strong>Your Consent</strong><p>By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.</p><br><strong>Contact Us</strong><p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at contactzen@protonmail.com.</p>
